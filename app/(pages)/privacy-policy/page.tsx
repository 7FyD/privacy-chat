          At <strong>Privacy Chat</strong>, your privacy is our top priority.
          Our service was designed to provide a secure platform for private
          conversations, ensuring the confidentiality of our users. Below,
          you'll find details on how we protect your privacy and what minimal
          information we interact with.

          What Information Do We Collect?
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We believe in keeping your data private. <strong>Privacy Chat</strong>{" "}
          does not collect or store any personal information or connection data.
          Hereâ€™s what you need to know:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>No Personal Data</strong>: We do not collect your name,
            email, IP address, or any other identifying information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Temporary Room Credentials</strong>: When a chat room is
            created, we generate a unique room ID that is temporarily stored to
            facilitate the conversation. This room ID is not linked to any
            personal information and is deleted as soon as the chat session
            ends.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Your conversations are entirely private and only accessible to those
          with the room credentials. Once a room is closed, all associated data
          is immediately and permanently deleted.
        </p>

          How Are Your Conversations Kept Private?

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Room Security</strong>: Each room ID is unique and secure,
            ensuring that only those with the credentials can access the
            conversation. The room credentials are deleted after the chat ends,
            ensuring no trace of the conversation remains on our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-Destructing Rooms</strong>: Privacy Chat is designed to
            ensure that all data associated with a room is irretrievably deleted
            once the conversation ends. This includes all messages and any other
            data related to the chat session.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Complete Anonymity</strong>: We prioritize your anonymity.
            No logs of conversations, user activities, or any other data are
            kept. This ensures your privacy is preserved at all times.
          </li>

          <strong>User Responsibility</strong>: While we do everything within
